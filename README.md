# Quaternion LTH

Code to run pruning experiments on quaternion neural networks. The methods to implement quaternion neural networks are borrowed from [hTorch](https://github.com/ispamm/hTorch), and the various pruning experiments are inspired from [open\_lth](https://github.com/facebookresearch/open\_lth).

## Installation
Install PyTorch version specific to the system. Then install packages from `requirements.txt`, followed by the local package in `htorch/` directory.
